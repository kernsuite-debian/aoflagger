/** \mainpage AOFlagger public interface API
*
* ### Introduction
* The AOFlagger is a flagger framework that implements several
* methods to deal with radio-frequency interference or RFI.
* Some of the implemented algorithms that are part of the flagging
* strategy, are the SumThreshold method,
* background fitting techniques (smoothing, sliding window, median
* filters, high-pass filters) and morphological operators.
* AOFlagger is distributed under the GPL 3 open-source license.
*
* I have spent a lot of time on this package, and I believe it is the
* best flagger available.
* If you use this package for scientific work, please acknowledge my work
* and cite the following two papers that have introduced the new algorithms:
* - <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16471.x">Post-correlation radio frequency interference classification methods</a>,
* Offringa et al. 2010, MNRAS, Volume 405, Issue 1, pages 155-167. This
* paper introduces the SumThreshold method and tests several signal estimation
* methods.
* - <a href="http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=doi&amp;doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201118497&amp;Itemid=129">A morphological algorithm for improving radio-frequency interference detection</a>, Offringa et al. 2012, A&A, Volume 539, Issue A95. This paper introduces the scale-invariant rank
* operator, a morphological operator to find samples with a high chance of
* RFI contamination.
*
* ### About the API
*
* This document describes the API of the public interface. This interface can
* be used to integrate the flagger into an observatory pipeline in an easy
* way, without having to know the internals of the flagger. If you want to
* integrate this flagger in your pipeline, the best place to start is to
* read the class description of class @ref aoflagger::AOFlagger.
*
* To use libaoflagger, add an "#include <aoflagger.h>" to your C++
* program and link with "-laoflagger". For installation instructions, check
* the website.
*
* The official webpage of the package is http://aoflagger.sourceforge.net/ .
* The full package contains this library along with several programs
* to execute the flagger on measurement sets, tweak it and visualize results.
* The package contains the following executables:
* - @c aoflagger: executes a given flagging strategy on a full measurement
* set (replacement for the older @c 'rficonsole' executable).
* - @c rfigui: for analyzing RFI, data and for strategy parameter tweaking.
* - @c aoqplot: for fast visualization of statistics, to assert the generic
* data quality.
* 
* See also the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/aoflagger/wiki/">AOFlagger
* Wiki</a> on Sourceforge for information, which includes a section with
* <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/aoflagger/wiki/faq/">Frequency Asked
* Questions</a>. Additionally, the 
* <a href="http://www.astron.nl/radio-observatory/lofar/lofar-imaging-cookbook">
* LOFAR imaging cookbook</a> contains a lot of general info about running the
* flagger.
