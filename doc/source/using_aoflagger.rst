Using ``aoflagger``
===================

The '``aoflagger``' executable can be used to flag a measurement set.
It is a stand-alone command-line tool, i.e., without a graphical interface, and is designed to work
fast and non-interactively.

To flag a measurement set:

.. code-block:: bash

    aoflagger [options] <observation.ms>

The list of options can be retrieved by running ``aoflagger`` without parameters.
