========== ================== 

This quick release, only two months after the previous release, is to make a feature available that was found to be required for Apertif: to temporary apply a passband by means of a text file. It also fixes some minor bugs.

Full list of changes:

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Apply passband action that can be used to read in and apply a text file with gain values, implemented `-bandpass` parameter for aoflagger
* New colourmap: cubehelix and "colourful" cubehelix

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* AOQPlot required X/graphics when in non-interactive mode
* Slight improvement to API interface (Make QualityStatistics nullable)
* Baseline plot was saved without colour (reported by B. McKinley)
* Fixing potential use of uninitialized value in aoqplot
