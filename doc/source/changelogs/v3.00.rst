========== ================== 

In version 3.00, AOFlagger has fully switched to using :doc:`Lua-scripted strategies <../designing_strategies>`. For this, the ``rfigui`` underwent a transformation, and now provides a simple Lua editor and runner. Furthermore, the AOFlagger repository has been migrated to Gitlab: https://gitlab.com/aroffringa/aoflagger is its new location. GitLab is faster, provides CI, an easier and more advanced ticketing system, merge requested, etc. Additionally, the old Wiki was transformed into Sphinx documentation that is automatically build and readable online at https://aoflagger.readthedocs.io/.

The full list of changes is given below.
