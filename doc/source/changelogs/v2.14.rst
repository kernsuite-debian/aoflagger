========== ================== 
 
This release contains some important bug fixes. Due to stricter requirements in gcc, 2.13 did no longer compile with new gcc versions. This is fixed in 2.14. There are also some new features that enable a good flagging strategy on concatenated LOFAR subbands.

Full list of changes:

^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Save and load single baseline into a binary file.
* Correct for smooth bandpasses.
