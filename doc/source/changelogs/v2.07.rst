Summary
^^^^^^^

No really shocking changes, but lots of small improvements. It is now possible to save quality statistic plots from the command line and to re-flag by opening quality statistics. There are also many small gui tweaks and a lot of small bugfixes. Release 2.7.0 supports both Casacore's 1.x and 2.x versions -- 2.7.1 will only support 2.0. The release of 2.7.1 was mainly to work around a bug in GTKMM in Ubuntu's latest distribution, causing the rfigui and aoqplot windows not to open.

Changes from 2.7.0 to 2.7.1 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

2.7.1 was released on 2015-09-02.

 * Bugfix: Fixed two compiler warnings
 * Bugfix: Applied patch by M. Sokolowski to correct time range of BIGHORN fits files
 * Bugfix: crash when opening main windows in certain GTKMM installations (notably the one currently in Ubuntu)

* Bugfix: Compiling without GTKMM results in undefined reference due to missing vdsfile.cpp on some platforms (reported by G. van Diepen).
* Bugfix: Making it possible to run strategies from the API that include plot actions, which includes the default LOFAR strategy.
