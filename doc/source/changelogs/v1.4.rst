========== ================== 

Changes:

* New action: absolute threshold. Useful for experimenting (not to be used otherwise).
* Speed increase of about 10% due to using a novel linear performing algorithm for the dilation. Algorithm provided by J. van de Gronde (article coming up).
* Several enhancements to fringe filters (see Offringa et al, 2011, in prep.).
* Enhanced performance of statistic collecting strategies.
* Added / enhanced possibility to experiment with spatial filters, thanks to a lot of input from U.-L. Pen.
* Esthetic changes to the gui by regrouping the menus.
* msinfo reports somewhat more useful info now.
* colormapper can now average fits images together and has some other useful features.
* Bugfix: Converging of sets with lots of RFI did not work correctly. Reported by R. van Weeren and D. Rafferty. Won't work for old strategies(!).
* Bugfix: Winsorized variance calculation is now more accurate with large amounts of RFI.
* Bugfix: Since the new actions screen was getting too large, the edit strategy now shows a menu of possible actions. Reported by A. Miskolczi.
* Bugfix: Removed unused parameters of the time selection action. Reported by P. Serra.
* Bugfix: Parameter -c removed from rfistrategy, as it did not work. Reported by F. De Gasperin.
* Several new unit tests to validate flagger steps.
* Some small fixes everywhere around.
