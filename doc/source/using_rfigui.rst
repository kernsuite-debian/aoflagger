Using ``rfigui``
================

The program's main window shows a time-frequency plot (dynamic spectrum) of a selected baseline and/or polarization, and from
there it is possible to analyse the data in various ways.

A few of its key features:

- Analyse Casa Measurement Sets, UVFits files and other supported formats;
- Make time-frequency diagrams and other cuts through the data;
- Export plots to pdfs (interactively or :doc:`scripted <programs_scripting>`);
- Execute and tweak flagging strategies;
- Visualize the uv plane and/or image plane for selected data.

A list of possible command line options can be obtained by running ``rfigui --help``. There are some options available to create images from the command line, see the :doc:`page on scripting <programs_scripting>`.
