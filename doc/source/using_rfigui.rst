Using ``rfigui``
================

The program's main window shows a time-frequency plot (dynamic spectrum) of a selected baseline and/or polarization, and from
there it is possible to analyse the data in various ways.

A few of its key features:

- Analyse Casa Measurement Sets, UVFits files and other supported formats;
- Make time-frequency diagrams and other cuts through the data;
- Export plots to pdfs (interactively or scripted);
- Execute and tweak flagging strategies;
- Visualize the uv plane and/or image plane for selected data.
