\fB\-strategy\fR
specifies a possible customized strategy
.TP
\fB\-direct\-read\fR
perform the slowest IO but will always work.
.TP
\fB\-indirect\-read\fR
reorder the measurement set before starting, which is normally
faster but requires free disk space to reorder the data to.
.TP
\fB\-memory\-read\fR
read the entire measurement set in memory. This is the fastest, but
requires much memory.
.TP
\fB\-auto\-read\-mode\fR
select either memory or direct mode based on available memory (default).
.TP
\fB\-skip\-flagged\fR
skip an ms if it has already been processed by AOFlagger according
to its HISTORY table.
.TP
\fB\-uvw\fR
reads uvw values (some exotic strategies require these)
.TP
\fB\-column\fR <name>
specify column to flag
.TP
\fB\-bands\fR <list>
comma separated list of (zero\-indexed) band ids to process
.TP
\fB\-fields\fR <list>
