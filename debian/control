Description: Find RFI in radio astronomical observations
 The AOFlagger is a tool that can find and remove radio-frequency interference
 (RFI) in radio astronomical observations. The code has been highly optimized
 for speed and accuracy. It is used by default for the LOFAR radio telescope
 and thus is in productional stage. The software can run in a fully automated
 way, but a graphical interface is provided to analyse results and tweak the
 strategy. The preferred input file format is the Casa Measurement Set (MS)
 format.
 .
 Besides the flagger, the software consists of tools to efficiently visualize
 data in different ways, such as plotting time-frequency diagrams and power
 spectra. It provides the programs aoflagger, rfigui, aoqplot, aoquality and
 more.
